#  Interactive Web-Based Quiz Platform

This repository contains the source code for a web-based quiz platform. The platform is equipped with an integrated quiz creation tool, quiz taker, question bank and a gamification feature for interactive quizzes. This platform was developed as part of the final year project for my Electrical and Electronic Engineering degree.

Currently there are already existing quiz platforms available. However, there is a lack for a singular product that incorporates both regular and gamified quizzes to cater for either professional or entertainment applications. Hence, this project aims to provides a versatile one-stop solution that addresses this problem. Its main objective is to enhance student participation and improve learning outcomes in classrooms. 

## Database and Website Hosting
The platform utilizes a **Microsoft Azure SQL Database** to store all quiz data. In order to attain the lowest latency and fastest load times, the geological location of server was set to East Asia, which was the best option for Malaysia.

The website is hosted using **Microsoft Azure Static Web Apps**. Thesee web apps have an integrated feature that allows them to connect seamlessly to an **Azure SQL Database** without needing any backend setup. The quiz platform will be deployed online as a web application, and the source files for website are stored in a GitHub repository.
