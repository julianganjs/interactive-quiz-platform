#  Interactive Web-Based Quiz Platform

This repository contains the source code for a web-based quiz platform. The platform is equipped with an integrated quiz creation tool, quiz taker, question bank and a gamification feature for interactive quizzes. This platform was developed as part of the final year project for my Electrical and Electronic Engineering degree.

The project's aim is to enhance student participation and improve learning outcomes in classrooms. Currently there are already existing quiz platforms available. However, there is a lack for a singular product that incorporates both regular and gamified quizzes to cater for either professional or entertainment applications. Hence, this project provides a one-stop solution that addresses this problem.
